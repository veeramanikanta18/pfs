1. state the difference between lists and tuples in python programming.
ans:
        -> list: lists are editable, which is mutable. 
                 slower.
        -> tuple: A tuple is a list that cannot be altered, which is immutable.
                  Faster.


2. factorial of a number?

def fact(n):
    if n == 1
        return 1
    else
        return n * fact(n-1)

n = int(input())
r = fact(n)
print(r)
